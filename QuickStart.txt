SportsNation skills allows you to get batting statistics for professional baseball players.  The supported statistics for batters are:
	*  Batting average
	*  RBI or runs batted in
	*  Slugging percentage
	*  Stolen bases
	*  On base percentage, 
	*  On base plus slugging
	*  Runs or runs scored
	*  Home runs
	*  Walks
	*  Strike outs
	*  Singles or hits

Speak the players name and ask for any one of these statistics either for career or specific year.  You can also get leader stats for a year or a range.

Here are some examples to get you started.

"Alexa, ask Sports Nation to get career home runs for Babe Ruth"

"Alexa, ask Sports Nation How many runs did Ted Williams have?"

"Alexa, as Sports Nation In 1946 who had the most strike outs?"

"Alexa, get me career stolen bases for Ricky Hendersion from Sports Nation."

"Alexa ask Sports Nation Who had the most RBIs in 1952?"

"Alexa ask Sports Nation between 1992 and 1994 who had most runs?"

Future version of the skill will include stats for teams, fielders, and pitchers.  And further own, the Sports Nation will be expanded to include stats for other sports.
